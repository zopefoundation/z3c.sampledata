Things to do as next. jukart, stephan other ideas?

- Implement a description concept which let us describe the different 
  sample data manager. This is usefull for presenting a description next to 
  the sample manager links in managesamples.html.

- Change default value for seed from lovely to sample or something neutral.
  This is needed since our customer uses the sampledata directly and that
  customer was one of the sponsor of this work.

  Done : jukart (changed default seed to "sample")

- Make the registration of a set of sampledata mangers possible. It should be
  possible to present a set of sampledata manager in a list. Perhaps this can 
  be done by adding a group attribute to the smaple data manager.
